## Track and Challenge
- **Track:** Student Lifestyle  
- **Challenge:** Tutoring For Students  


## Background
Many students struggle with academic challenges, including difficulty understanding course material, limited access to personalized help, and inefficient study habits. 

Traditional tutoring services are often expensive, inconvenient, or unavailable outside of fixed hours, leaving students without adequate support when they need it most. This gap hinders academic performance, increases stress, and discourages independent learning.


## Problem Statement
Develop a tutoring platform that provides on-demand, affordable, and personalized academic assistance. The platform will connect students with qualified tutors (including peer tutors), offer interactive learning tools, and provide access to curated study resources. 

By making tutoring more accessible and effective, this solution aims to:
- Enhance learning outcomes  
- Boost student confidence  
- Promote independent learning for students of all levels
